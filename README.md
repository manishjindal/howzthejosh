# How'z the Josh! 
This software recognizes human emotions from a video or webcam feed. Powered by OpenCV and Deep Learning.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/prithviraju/howzthejosh.git
cd howzthejosh/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 emotions.py
```

## To train new models for emotion classification

- Download the fer2013.tar.gz file from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)
- Move the downloaded file to the datasets directory inside this repository.
- Untar the file:
`tar -xzf fer2013.tar`
- Download train_emotion_classifier.py from orriaga's repo [here](https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification/blob/master/src/train_emotion_classifier.py)
- Run the train_emotion_classification.py file:
`python3 train_emotion_classifier.py`


## Deep Learning Model

The model used is from this [research paper](https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification/blob/master/report.pdf) written by Octavio Arriaga, Paul G. Plöger, and Matias Valdenegro.
